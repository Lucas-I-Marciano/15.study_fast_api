Middleware
    It takes each request that comes to your application.
    It can then do something to that request or run any needed code.
    Then it passes the request to be processed by the rest of the application (by some path operation).
    It then takes the response generated by the application (by some path operation).
    It can do something to that response or run any needed code.
    Then it returns the response

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    when a frontend communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different "origin"
    
    Origin
        An origin is the combination of protocol (http, https), domain (myapp.com, localhost, localhost.tiangolo.com), and port (80, 443, 8080).
    
    Steps   
        Frontend: http://localhost:8080
        Backend: http://localhost:80
        Frotend HTTP OPTIONS request to :80 -> 
        -> backend send headers authorizing the communication from this different origin ->
        -> frontend (:8080) let the JavaScript in the frontend send its request (GET, POST ...) to the backend (:80)
    
    Wildcards
        It's also possible to declare the list as "*" (a "wildcard") to say that all are allowed
        But that will only allow certain types of communication, excluding everything that involves credentials
