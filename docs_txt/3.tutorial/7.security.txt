    OAuth2: It includes ways to authenticate using a "third party"
    OAuth 1:There was an OAuth 1, which is very different from OAuth2, and more complex, as it included direct specifications on how to encrypt the communication
    OpenID Connect: It just extends OAuth2 specifying some things that are relatively ambiguous in OAuth2
    OpenID (not "OpenID Connect"): That tried to solve the same thing as OpenID Connect, but was not based on OAuth2
    OpenAPI
        OpenAPI defines the following security schemes: apiKey, http, oauth2, openIdConnect
