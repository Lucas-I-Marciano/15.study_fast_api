Response Model - Return Type
    Use '->' at functions
    You can filter what fields do you want to get from input and what do you want to show at output 

Extra Models
    You can declare more types of response: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-models/#union-or-anyof

Response Status Code
    100 and above are for "Information"
    200 and above are for "Successful" responses
    300 and above are for "Redirection"
    400 and above are for "Client error" responses
    500 and above are for server errors
    Code
        from fastapi import status
        that way you can use the editor's autocomplete to find them
        Remember to declare on 'decorator' parameter 'status'

Form Data
    Use Form to declare form data input parameters.
    For example, in one of the ways the OAuth2 specification can be used (called "password flow") it is required to send a username and password as form fields

Request Files
    UploadFile has the following attributes:
        filename
        content_type
        file: This is the actual Python file object that you can pass directly to other functions or libraries that expect a "file-like" object

    UploadFile has the following async methods
        write(data): Writes data (str or bytes) to the file.
        read(size): Reads size (int) bytes/characters of the file.
        seek(offset): Goes to the byte position offset (int) in the file.
        close(): Closes the file.
    Use File, bytes, and UploadFile to declare files to be uploaded in the request, sent as form data.
    Use File and Form together when you need to receive data and files in the same request
