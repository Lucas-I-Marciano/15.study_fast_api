Response Model - Return Type
    Use '->' at functions
    You can filter what fields do you want to get from input and what do you want to show at output

    You can declare more types of response: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/extra-models/#union-or-anyof

Response Status Code
    100 and above are for "Information"
    200 and above are for "Successful" responses
    300 and above are for "Redirection"
    400 and above are for "Client error" responses
    500 and above are for server errors
    Code
        from fastapi import status
        that way you can use the editor's autocomplete to find them
        Remember to declare on 'decorator' parameter 'status'
