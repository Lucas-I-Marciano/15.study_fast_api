Handling Errors
    HTTPException: Because it's a Python exception, you don't return it, you raise it.
    1st way: raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    2nd way: Create a custom model exception
    3rd way: Overriding default functions
        RequestValidationError: Raised when a STRING is sending when function expect an INTEGER
        from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException 
            Overriding StarletteHTTPException -> It will be the response of evert HTTPException -> 'from fastapi import HTTPException'
